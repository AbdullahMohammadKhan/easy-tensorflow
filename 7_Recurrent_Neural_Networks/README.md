# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## Introduction

In this tutorial we will learn about implementing Recurrent Neural Network in TensorFlow. RNN's charactristics makes it suitable for many different tasks; from simple  
The network structure is shown in the following figure and has classification accuracy of
above 99% on MNIST data.
